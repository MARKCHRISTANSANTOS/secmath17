## The Tidyverse

to install the tidyverse use the code:

`install.packages("tidyverse")`.

We also installed other packaged by typing in the console the following code:

`c("arrow","babynames","curl","duckdb","gapminder","ggrepel","ggridges","ggthemes","hexbin""janitor","Lahman","leaflet","maps""nycflights13","openxlsx","palmerpenguins","repurrrsive","tidymodels","writexl"))`

## Data Visualization

::: callout-note
## Reminder

First load `tidyverse` packages
:::

```{r}
#|load-packages 

library(palmerpenguins)
library(ggthemes)
library(tidyverse)
```

## First Steps

```{r}
penguins
```

```{r}
glimpse(penguins)
```

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false 
#| echo: false
ggplot(
  data = penguins,
  mapping = aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = body_mass_g)
) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(
    title = "Body mass and flipper length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for Adelie, Chinstrap, and Gentoo Penguins",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Body mass (g)",
    color = "Species", shape = "Species"
  ) +
  scale_color_colorblind()
```
